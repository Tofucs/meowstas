  Our project is a cat pokemon game where players can collect cat-pokemon and battle with gym leaders.
  The gym leaders are AI bots that choose attacks semi-randomly.
  Pokemon also have status effects that can be inflicted on them by attacks, and there are items that heal or buff pokemon.

  Currently, it is completely terminal based, but in the future, we are looking to create a GUI.
